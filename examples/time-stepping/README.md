# Time Stepping Example

This example provides a realistic time-step plan and scheduling policy for a
multiphase-field simulation with ramping and checkpoint planning. The parameters
are tuned for a longer run with moderate output cadence.

Run from repo root:

```bash
bash examples/time-stepping/run_timestep_plan.sh
bash examples/time-stepping/run_output_schedule.sh
bash examples/time-stepping/run_checkpoint_plan.sh
```
